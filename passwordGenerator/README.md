React Projects Collection

This repository contains multiple mini-projects built using React and Vite. Each project is designed to practice React fundamentals, component-based architecture, and integration with modern tools like Vite and ESLint.

Projects Included

bgChanger – A small app to dynamically change background colors.

counter – A basic counter app to practice React state management.

currencyConvertor – A simple currency converter with live calculations.

passwordGenerator – A utility app to generate strong passwords.

Features

React + Vite Setup: Minimal and optimized setup with fast HMR (Hot Module Replacement).

ESLint Integration: Ensures clean and consistent code.

Component-Based Architecture: Each app demonstrates reusable React components.

Modern Development Practices: Using hooks, state management, and event handling.

Getting Started



# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
